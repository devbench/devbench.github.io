# About us
Welcome to DevBench. We are two freelance web developers based in Kent, UK.

We specialise in website builds which create a fantastic user experience. We are usability experts and create websites which work on all browser and mobile devices (iPad, iPhone, Android devices etc).

Between us we have almost 20 years of industry experience and specialise in the following technical areas: PHP, HTML, CSS, JS, and in the past couple of years have moved into new technologies such as NodeJS and Responsive design.

We can fit to your needs whether that be a static website for a new venture or a full ecommerce system with paypal integration. All of our packages can include hosting and domain setup and we can work to a budget!
